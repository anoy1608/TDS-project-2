Overview

This project is an analysis of media ratings (movies, TV series, and books) provided by course faculty. The data includes ratings from faculty members across different genres and media types, which I've analyzed to uncover patterns and preferences.

Data

The dataset contains:

Title: Name of the media (movie, TV series, or book).
Type: Categorization of the media (Movie, TV Series, or Book).
Faculty Name: Faculty member rating the media.
Rating: Rating given by the faculty (1-5).
Genre: Genre of the media (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy, Fiction).

Analysis

I performed various analyses, including:

Average ratings across different media types.
Genre-wise rating comparison.
Faculty-based preference analysis to identify trends.
Rating distribution to understand how consistently media is rated.
